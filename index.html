        <h3> About Ringette</h3>
        
        <p>Ringette is a uniquely <em>Canadian</em> winter sport that's as challenging as it is enjoyable. <br>It was created by Sam Jacks in 1963 and has since been dubbed the <strong>fastest sport on ice.</strong></p>

<p>The main objective of ringette is to use a stick to hit a ring into the opposing team's goal. The team with the highest score at the end wins.</p>
